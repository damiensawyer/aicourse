# intro
- Tensorflow is dying, Pytorch is growing
- Pytorch takes a lot of code. FastAI is a library built on PyTorch

## Notesbooks
development is done with Jupyter notebooks. This is a tool that allows you to run code inline. 
I have setup a docker file to run it locally in this project. 
You can also get them free online with places like Kaggle.com

## Different types of machine learning
- Image Classifier: Is this a bird? Is this image of a sound a siren?
- Segmentation: In this scene, which pixels are buildlings, which are cars, which is rooad [here](https://youtu.be/8SF_h3xF3cE?si=3Ydjh294nrHAm5JI&t=3369)
- Tabular Analysis: Working with spreadsheet data etc? Income prediction etc - https://youtu.be/8SF_h3xF3cE?si=RaQR896ZYrjpNaoI&t=3534
- Collaborative Filtering: Finding products you might like or music based on what similar people liked. https://youtu.be/8SF_h3xF3cE?si=z72jB-wblhLR5O1O&t=3743




## Learning
- with image models you often start with a pretrained set (all in FastAI) and Fine Tune to match yours
- With tabular analysis, you don't fine tube, you 'fit', because tabular data is usually unique.
